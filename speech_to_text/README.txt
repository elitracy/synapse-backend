Run initially with silenceSplit.py
Will write to a folder called audio-chunks
May need to create folder beforehand.
Arguments: <Agressiveness> <Filename.wav>
Will only take wav files, not mp3 files. Remember to convert them before doing anything

Next, run wavUtils.py
This will read what's in audio chunks and then output it into output.txt
Remember to clear out audio-chunks between runs

Everything should be in requirements.txt
Think I also accidentally uploaded the virtual environemt to git too lol.
