You're listening to ted talks daily i'm elise hugh today we're geeking out about mushrooms in his 2022 talk from tedx oslo met mushroom researcher david andrew quist shares the impressive and planet imperative powers of fungi and the promises they carry for sustainability in the present and future after a short break. 
Ted talks daily is brought to you by progressive where customers who say if i switching their home and car save nearly $800 on average quote at progressive.com progressive casualty insurance company and affiliates national average homeless savings of $793 by new customer service between june 2021 and may 2022 potential savings will vary. 
Okay people let's just get this out of the way okay now i know this isn't a very comfortable subject for many of you. 
But i got to say. 
We have to talk about your fungus problem okay now it's okay. 
Don't be embarrassed you know who you are we can work this out we'll get it through it together now call them fungi fungi fungi. 
You decide. 
But what i'd like to impress upon you is this is a new world we need to begin explore. 
I think we can do it in interesting ways. 
We think of fun joe we think of that fuzzy stuff that's growing on our yogurt that we forgot in the back of the fridge right or maybe that it's you developed by wearing that favorite pair of pants but just got a little bit too tight. 
Or you know maybe you think of death and decay and disease when you think about fungi. 
But fungi yeah maybe some of them have a dark side i mean who of us doesn't. 
I'd like to invite you to see these under misunderstood creatures in a new light and maybe start to appreciate some of the ways some of the positive ways and inspirational ways that they behave. 
So if that molt is breaking bad on that yogurt that you forgot in the back of the fridge again. 
Baby it's taking an act of transformation of renewal and of new possibilities and it's that very act. 
Has been important for our own history. 
And maybe for the future. 
If we can learn from fungi we might be able to transform ourselves in our societies in ways that are in greater harmony with nature. 
I'm not talking about that amazing mushroom trip that you took back in university. 
That was probably pretty awesome in its own right. 
What i'm talking about is the way that fungi have been central to the evolution of life on the planet that virtually all of life has a fungal backstory. 
Don't think funds have been on the planet for a billion years a billion years or more. 
The earth was just a rocky desolate place it was not a life on it. 
The algae would actually escape the waters and come on the land to evolve into land plants but only by partnering with fungi first as its root system. 
Soils would begin to form as fungiate rock and break down to make the nutrients available. 
So you have this opportunity for new life to spring up. 
And allow the evolution of more complex life forms like us humans. 
Through all the five great mass extinction events. 
What fungi persistent and thrived and due to this day. 
Who doesn't love a good survival story. 
Put fungi weren't my first love that was music actually and. 
Actually when i was a young young boy i was really into grunge music and i played in a grunge band and we were. 
Awful but i didn't know that at the time and i had to follow my passion so i put everything in my pickup truck and i moved from my childhood home of kansas city to seattle the mecca of grunge music in the 90s and i was going to start a new band. 
And unfortunately none of none of the talents of nirvana or soundgarden rubbed off on me would have been a quite different life had it did but the splendor of the pacific northwest forest really did. 
And it was the trees and all the life above ground that drew me there but it was the fungi in the microbes blow ground that kept me coming back. 
Right i just got even more and more interested about the way that they lived all these bizarre forms the fact that fungi are literally everywhere. 
Right now they're on your skin. 
In your gut with every breath you take you inhale fungal spores every move you make you trample mushrooms and molds beneath your feet. 
In the soil. 
And they're ubiquity. 
It's a big reason why we know so little about fungi despite all the tools we have at our disposal scientific tools we know perhaps 5% of all the funds i some 3 million species that are thought to exist. 
On the world in the world today. 
But that's a massive amount of biodiversity that we know virtually nothing about how it lives and what it does. 
And that's what really inspired me to continue to study about fungi. 
Help in creating a more resilient future. 
Right what can we actually learn from fungi were there metaphors that we might to apply to how we live to create a more resilient future together. 
I'd like to share with you some of them some of those metaphors. 
The first is that fungi or bio-intelligent. 
Being on the planet for so long fungi have created a really great ability to be good at at resource efficiency and resilience. 
As it turns out special planning so researchers in japan did this super cool experiment where they laid out they wanted to see if i could help engineers to create more efficient transport networks. 
So they laid out oatmeal on a petri dish corresponding to the cities of the tokyo metropolitan area. 
And they introduced the slime mold a type of fungus whose favorite is food ever is oatmeal. 
And the fungus rapidly went through a process of self-optimization to find the most efficient links between its favors. 
Represented by a map of the tokyo metropolitan area. 
And in a matter of hours. 
It would recreate largely the existing railway map of the tokyo metropolitan area. 
A process it took engineers decades to actually produce. 
It has no brain. 
But still it created a highly optimized network. 
To help solve some of our human challenges in ways that are quick. 
And efficient and perhaps even more imaginative than we could do with all of our brains put together. 
Now another way that fungi are can produce a metaphor is being collaborative. 
I remember how algae evolved into plants to the help of fungi and its root system well that love affair never ended. 
Still today 90% of all land plants need to have a mycorrhizal association this is the plant fungus root association. 
Symbiosis. 
They're providing carbon. 
So this exchange can go on between the organisms but it doesn't stop there. 
Because the sponge i can tap into other plants at the same time another plants can have also other fungal partners. 
It's not just nutrients they're flowing but also communication because plants can talk to each other through the fungal network to create to perhaps to chemical signals to be able to warn of pest attack for example. 
Fungi or also regenerative. 
Now their ability to decompose. 
Is important for the planet to say the least because fungi eat death. 
Everything is used everything is circular. 
Everything becomes something else. 
Dead animals and poo. 
Without the decompositional ability and that would be a pretty crappy existence you got to admit. 
With ways of being bio intelligent collaborative and resilient. 
But i also believe that fungi have practical implications and how we produce materials. 
This is actually my very cool day job as researcher at a fermentation science company here in oslo that's reimagining a new world of materials more sustainable materials of everyday products. 
Let me give you some examples. 
So one is biomaterials. 
Taking a fungus we can literally grow new materials using agricultural residues to replace unsustainable products like styrofoam or rockwool. 
Often end up in landfills or in pollution. 
So we can grow things like soundproofing panels or insulation to buildings. 
Or we can make. 
Mushroom frisbees like the possibilities. 
So for example animal free leathers. 
So normally i mean usually you have a cow and it takes about 3 years to make a leather and all the resources and animal death. 
Is involved not a great way to make leather if you can make it another way like with fungi. 
It takes days to make it using fungi. 
And then there's food a subject i'm particularly passionate about now we can make a whole range of sustainable and delicious foods from fungi things like meat replacements for seafood or dairy for example or even a new class of food that doesn't look like any of that stuff. 
Possibilities are unlimited. 
And we can do it in a way that is a fraction of the environment footprint. 
And lower our impact on the planet it's a big challenge. 
And last but not least fish feed i mean here we are in norway right. 
The world's largest producer of salmon and what do we feed that salmon is proteins two things primarily soy and fish meal. 
Neither of which are sustainable sources of protein for the future because they contribute to overfishing in the oceans and land use patterns that degrade. 
So we need to come up with more sustainable sources and how we feed our fish. 
What if we could do it using fungi. 
Would be an amazingly sustainable system. 
Sufficiency. 
That one of the coolest things about being a fungal researcher is with all that diversity out there probably the coolest thing that fungi can do. 
We haven't even uncovered yet. 
The most amazing fungal discoveries are still waiting to be made. 
Only scratching the surface of what we might be able to achieve with the help of fungi. 
So i have a hope. 
My hope is that we transfer our fungal problems into fungal solutions. 
That we look to the fungal world for new mindsets and new metaphors and even new materials. 
As we think more collaboratively regeneratively and with more by intelligence as we approach the future. 
Just like fungi thank you very much.
